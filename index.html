            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                About 3 years back, when I was pregnant, I faced a lot of issues because I live in a nuclear family
                where both my husband and I were working.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this experience came the idea of making life of working women (and women in general) a bit easy
                with this concept of an online portal for vegetables and fruits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fruit Network is launched to help these people, to help people with busy lifestyles. I wanted to help
                women improve the quality of their lives!
            </p>
